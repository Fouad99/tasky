Service Directory â€“ Definition & Purpose
The service/ directory is responsible for business logic orchestration. It acts as the implementation layer for the input ports (use cases),
ensuring that the application's core operations are executed according to defined rules and workflows.

What Goes Here?
Service Implementations (impl/)

Concrete classes that implement the input port interfaces (TaskManagementPort, TaskAssignmentPort, UserManagementPort).
These services interact with the domain layer and delegate calls to the output ports when external interactions (e.g., persistence, APIs) are needed.
Transactional Logic

Ensures data integrity and consistency across different operations.
Can be annotated with @Transactional when needed (e.g., Spring-managed transactions).
Validation & Business Rules

Enforces domain constraints and ensures that operations follow the correct business logic.
Event Handling (Optional)

If the system supports domain events, this layer may include logic to publish or react to them.
