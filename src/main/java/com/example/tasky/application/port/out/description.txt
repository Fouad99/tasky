Definition of ports/out (Output Ports)
The ports/out package defines interfaces for external dependencies that the application interacts with, such as databases, external APIs, messaging systems,
or third-party services. These interfaces serve as abstractions, allowing the core business logic to remain decoupled from the specific implementation details
of these external components.

The key purpose of output ports is to:
✅ Ensure that business logic does not depend on infrastructure details (such as databases or HTTP clients).
✅ Allow easy swapping of external systems (e.g., switching from SQL to NoSQL, replacing an API provider, etc.).
✅ Enable better testability by allowing the use of mocks or stubs in unit tests.

Possible Interfaces in ports/out
1️⃣ TaskPersistencePort
📌 Purpose: Abstracts persistence operations for tasks.
🔹 Used by: The service layer to interact with a database.
🔹 Methods could include:
        saveTask(Task task) → Persists a new or updated task.
        findTaskById(UUID id) → Retrieves a task by ID.
        findAllTasks() → Fetches all tasks.
        deleteTask(UUID id) → Deletes a task.

2️⃣ NotificationPort
📌 Purpose: Sends notifications when certain task-related events occur (e.g., task assigned, completed).
🔹 Used by: The service layer to trigger notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications.
🔹 Methods could include:

    sendTaskAssignedNotification(Task task, User user) → Notifies a user when assigned to a task.
    sendTaskCompletedNotification(Task task) → Notifies relevant parties when a task is completed.

These output ports ensure that business logic remains focused on the domain, withoutworrying about whether tasks are stored in a database, an API, or a file system.
The actual implementation of these ports will be provided by adapters in the infrastructure/adapter/out/ layer.
