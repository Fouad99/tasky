Breakdown of adapter/in (Inbound Adapters)
Inbound adapters handle incoming requests from external sources and translate them into a format understood by the application. They consume input
from various entry points, such as APIs, events, or other integrations, and delegate business logic to application services via ports/in.

What belongs in adapter/in?
    adapter/in/web

        Purpose: Exposes HTTP-based endpoints (e.g., REST controllers) for external consumers.
        Contains:
        controller/ → Implements port/in/api interfaces (e.g., TaskController, UserController).
        dto/ → Data transfer objects for API requests/responses (e.g., TaskRequestDto, TaskResponseDto).
        mapper/ → Converts between dto objects and domain models.

    adapter/in/event

        Purpose: Listens to incoming events (e.g., from a message broker like Kafka) and processes them.
        Contains:
        Event listeners implementing port/in interfaces (e.g., TaskEventListener).

Breakdown of adapter/out (Outbound Adapters)
Outbound adapters handle outgoing communication with external systems. They implement port/out interfaces and serve as the bridge
between the core application and infrastructure concerns like databases, messaging, or third-party APIs.

What belongs in adapter/out?
    adapter/out/persistence

        Purpose: Implements database interactions using JPA, JDBC, or other persistence mechanisms.
        Contains:
        entity/ → Database entities (e.g., TaskEntity, UserEntity).
        repository/ → Implements port/out/persistence interfaces using JPA repositories (e.g., TaskRepository).
        mapper/ → Converts between entities and domain models.

    adapter/out/external

        Purpose: Handles calls to third-party services or APIs (e.g., sending notifications, fetching data from an external system).
        Contains:
        Implementations of port/out/external interfaces (e.g., ExternalApiAdapter).
        adapter/out/messaging (If applicable)

        Purpose: Sends messages to an external message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
        Contains:
        Implementations of port/out/messaging interfaces (e.g., MessagingAdapter).
